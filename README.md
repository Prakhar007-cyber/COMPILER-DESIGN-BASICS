DESCRIPTION:

*This compiler frontend implements lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and evaluation of mathematical expressions. The recursive-descent parser handles operator precedence (PEMDAS) and associativity correctly, supporting parentheses grouping, exponentiation, and basic arithmetic operations. The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface provides immediate feedback with syntax error detection and recovery. Implementation highlights include a finite-state automaton for tokenization and abstract syntax tree construction for evaluation. The system demonstrates fundamental compiler construction techniques while remaining practical for interactive calculation tasks, with extensions possible for variables or functions. Error handling covers both syntactic and semantic cases like division by zero.*
